<p>Jenkins is a powerful application that allows Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment of projects, regardless of the
platform you are working on. It is a free source that can handle
any kind of build or continuous integration. You can integrate
Jenkins with a number of testing and deployment technologies. </p>

A beginner can write a basic script and deploy a few cloud
instances in just a day.</p>
<p>For configuration management, its just too easy to learn and
write in ANSIBLE as it understands “yaml” format. Developer

<p>Ansible always runs in order and exits immediately when an
error occurs.&nbsp;Also while using Ansible, one has to know about
the commands that they need to give. For example yum for redhat
distributions and apt-get for ubuntu etc. In chef or puppet, they
take care of translating to individual distribution and user need
not worry about specifying correct commands as per the
distribution.</p>

scale.</p>
